      			<p>The Navy SEAL Foundation stands behind all U.S. Navy SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, Naval Special Warfare support personnel, and their spouses and children. The Foundation coordinates closely with NSW commands to support critical needs of active-duty operators while also providing resources for NSW veterans. Our work is focused on three key areas: family services and command support, educational programs, and legacy activities.</p>
				<p>The Foundation was formed in 2000 and underwent a name change in January 2011 when the SEAL-Naval Special Warfare Foundation and the Navy SEAL Warrior Fund combined their organizations. The merger makes it easier for families to receive assistance and support from one organization, while enabling the Foundation to respond rapidly to their needs.</p>
				<p>Mission Statement<br>
				  Our mission is to provide immediate and ongoing support and assistance to the Naval Special Warfare community and their families.</p>
				<p>Statement of Purpose<br>
				  Established to serve U.S. Navy SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, Naval Special Warfare (NSW) support personnel, and their families, the Navy SEAL Foundation offers critical support to Naval Special Warfare commands, active-duty personnel, their families and veterans of NSW. As the duration and frequency of training and operational deployments continue, and the stress on the families and operators grows, this important community requires support today more than ever.</p>

				<p>Pre-construction and Design Services Contract: Flagship and its related homebuilding company, FLAGG Coastal Homes are experienced builders, subscribing to the notion that the most important step in constructing a new home is developing a quality plan. Not only must the site conditions be taken into account, but neighborhood, street presence, engineering and environmental conditions and importantly budget and schedule are all essential aspects of the plan. We are often asked to address and embrace the coastal charm of Coronado relying on our experience in building in this very unique environment</p>
                <p>Plan Approval &amp; Permitting:   Based on our experience in developing and re-developing more than 30 homes in Coronado, we have a keen understanding of the permitting process for Coronado.  According to the complexity or size of the site, Flagship will also develop a schematic landscape and hardscape plan </p>
                <p>Schedule and Budget: Also included in the Pre-Construction Phase, Flagg will develop a &ldquo;Preliminary Budget and Building Schedule.&rdquo; This budget will contain a number of allowances for items such as cabinets, countertops, appliances and the like. Both Flagship, the development company; and Flagg Coastal Homes, the licensed contractor will utilize experiences from the past  30 &ldquo;Coastal Homes&rdquo; in Coronado to formulate a better, more refined budget and schedule. That experience translates into a comfort level and assurances that the home is in the hands of experienced professionals. </p>
                <p>Construction Activities: Upon receipt of a building permit Flagship&rsquo;s role in pre-development will terminate and FLAGG Inc. the licensed and insured general contractor will execute a Construction Contract. Based on our experience, the &ldquo;Cost Plus a Fee&rdquo; contract including an appropriate contingency, allows the most efficient manner of work progression and minimizes the use of &ldquo;Change Orders&rdquo;  Recent experience in Coronado suggests that FLAGG is able to complete a new Coastal Home from start work to final permit in  8-11 months</p>

    			<p>Coronado, also known as Coronado Island, is an affluent resort city located in San Diego County, California, across San Diego Bay from downtown San Diego.[4] Its population was 24,697 at the 2010 census,[2][3] up from 24,100 at the 2000 census. Coronado lies on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a 10-mile (16 km) isthmus called the Silver Strand (locally, The Strand.) Locals sometimes call Coronado Nado or Coronado Island, and they denote the core living and business area as The Village. In May 2012, Dr. Stephen Leatherman, Director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research, ranked Coronado Beach as the best beach in the United States.[5] <br>
		      Coronado is Spanish for &quot;the crowned one&quot;, and thus it is nicknamed The Crown City. There have been three ships of the United States Navy named after the city, including the USS Coronado (LCS-4).</p>
