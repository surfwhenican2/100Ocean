			<h1>Q. When will Senior Formal prices and tickets be released?</h1> 
			Tickets went live April 11th at 12:00pm. See the sections on Tickets & Transportation for more information and the link to purchase tickets.
			Tickets will include two drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and of course great music, great venue, great friends! We’ll also have lots of fun activities during the night,
			including a photobooth, two dance floors, and live performances. 
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Can I bring a non-Senior or a non-Stanford student to Senior Formal?</h1>
			Yes, tickets will be available for non-Seniors provided they are accompanied by a member of the Class of 2013 (these will be available at the standard price). Tickets will also be available for non-Stanford students, though there may be a surcharge.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Will I need tickets for Bing Senior Arts Gala?</h1>
			The event is definitely free. You might need to get a ticket in advance... we'll let you know over email.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. How can I get tickets for the San Francisco Senior Night?</h1>
			Due to the extremely positive feedback from last quarter's SF Senior Night, we wanted to provide the class with another event in the city. We will be helping coordinate transportation for more people, however, due again to our limited funds and the
			high expenses associated with transportation to San Francisco, we will only be able to provide limited seats on buses for free. When these tickets become available, we will send out a link to the Senior Class as well as post it on a Facebook event similar to the process from last quarter.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Do I need to buy tickets for Senior Workshops?</h1>
			No tickets will be required for Senior Workshops! However, space will be limited at these events (we haven't quite set a cap on them yet), so we will communicate more details on whether you will have to sign up or whether they will be first-come-first-serve events!
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. What time will the Senior Workshops be?
			Timing of the Senior Workshops is TBA, but plan on them being in the evening after dinner.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. I have more questions! Who should I contact?</h1>
			You can email any member of the Class of 2013 Cabinet. Alternatively, you can email stanfordscp2013@gmail.com, and we will do our best to get back to you as soon as possible!
