			<h1>Q. When will Senior Formal prices and tickets be released?</h1> 
			Tickets went live April 11th at 12:00pm. See the sections on Tickets & Transportation for more information and the link to purchase tickets.
			Tickets will include two drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and of course great music, great venue, great friends! We’ll also have lots of fun activities during the night,
			including a photobooth, two dance floors, and live performances. 
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Can I bring a non-Senior or a non-Stanford student to Senior Formal?</h1>
			Yes, tickets will be available for non-Seniors provided they are accompanied by a member of the Class of 2013 (these will be available at the standard price). Tickets will also be available for non-Stanford students, though there may be a surcharge.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Will I need tickets for Bing Senior Arts Gala?</h1>
			The event is definitely free. You might need to get a ticket in advance... we'll let you know over email.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. How can I get tickets for the San Francisco Senior Night?</h1>
			Due to the extremely positive feedback from last quarter's SF Senior Night, we wanted to provide the class with another event in the city. We will be helping coordinate transportation for more people, however, due again to our limited funds and the
			high expenses associated with transportation to San Francisco, we will only be able to provide limited seats on buses for free. When these tickets become available, we will send out a link to the Senior Class as well as post it on a Facebook event similar to the process from last quarter.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. Do I need to buy tickets for Senior Workshops?</h1>
			No tickets will be required for Senior Workshops! However, space will be limited at these events (we haven't quite set a cap on them yet), so we will communicate more details on whether you will have to sign up or whether they will be first-come-first-serve events!
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. What time will the Senior Workshops be?
			Timing of the Senior Workshops is TBA, but plan on them being in the evening after dinner.
			<br /><br />
			<h1>Q. I have more questions! Who should I contact?</h1>
			You can email any member of the Class of 2013 Cabinet. Alternatively, you can email stanfordscp2013@gmail.com, and we will do our best to get back to you as soon as possible!

			<p>Flagship Properties is a privately held real estate development and brokerage company located in Coronado California. Founded in 1975, the company has developed, marketed and sold quality residential and office building developments throughout Southern California. Since 1999, Flagship has specialized in &quot;Coastal Homes&quot; primarily in Coronado, and has completed 30 homes on the Island. FLAGG COASTAL HOMES, the separate building company, was founded in 2007 to complement Flagship's development and brokerage activities. FLAGG is a licensed contractor specializing in Design/Build activities.</p>
			<p>FLAGG has been an innovator on the island selecting new concrete composite siding PVC and poly-styrene trim. These new materials were selected to withstand the direct sun and coastal environment</p>

			<p>The professionals at Flagg, particularly Carrie and John OBrien, Mark Blore of BSC, Martin Brown of St. Lucia Builders and Beth Delano of Shipshape Interiors wish you many happy memories and special occasions in your FLAGG COASTAL HOME in Coronado.</p>

      			<p>The Navy SEAL Foundation stands behind all U.S. Navy SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, Naval Special Warfare support personnel, and their spouses and children. The Foundation coordinates closely with NSW commands to support critical needs of active-duty operators while also providing resources for NSW veterans. Our work is focused on three key areas: family services and command support, educational programs, and legacy activities.</p>
				<p>The Foundation was formed in 2000 and underwent a name change in January 2011 when the SEAL-Naval Special Warfare Foundation and the Navy SEAL Warrior Fund combined their organizations. The merger makes it easier for families to receive assistance and support from one organization, while enabling the Foundation to respond rapidly to their needs.</p>
				<p>Mission Statement<br>
				  Our mission is to provide immediate and ongoing support and assistance to the Naval Special Warfare community and their families.</p>
				<p>Statement of Purpose<br>
				  Established to serve U.S. Navy SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, Naval Special Warfare (NSW) support personnel, and their families, the Navy SEAL Foundation offers critical support to Naval Special Warfare commands, active-duty personnel, their families and veterans of NSW. As the duration and frequency of training and operational deployments continue, and the stress on the families and operators grows, this important community requires support today more than ever.</p>

				<p>Pre-construction and Design Services Contract: Flagship and its related homebuilding company, FLAGG Coastal Homes are experienced builders, subscribing to the notion that the most important step in constructing a new home is developing a quality plan. Not only must the site conditions be taken into account, but neighborhood, street presence, engineering and environmental conditions and importantly budget and schedule are all essential aspects of the plan. We are often asked to address and embrace the coastal charm of Coronado relying on our experience in building in this very unique environment</p>
                <p>Plan Approval &amp; Permitting:   Based on our experience in developing and re-developing more than 30 homes in Coronado, we have a keen understanding of the permitting process for Coronado.  According to the complexity or size of the site, Flagship will also develop a schematic landscape and hardscape plan </p>
                <p>Schedule and Budget: Also included in the Pre-Construction Phase, Flagg will develop a &ldquo;Preliminary Budget and Building Schedule.&rdquo; This budget will contain a number of allowances for items such as cabinets, countertops, appliances and the like. Both Flagship, the development company; and Flagg Coastal Homes, the licensed contractor will utilize experiences from the past  30 &ldquo;Coastal Homes&rdquo; in Coronado to formulate a better, more refined budget and schedule. That experience translates into a comfort level and assurances that the home is in the hands of experienced professionals. </p>
                <p>Construction Activities: Upon receipt of a building permit Flagship&rsquo;s role in pre-development will terminate and FLAGG Inc. the licensed and insured general contractor will execute a Construction Contract. Based on our experience, the &ldquo;Cost Plus a Fee&rdquo; contract including an appropriate contingency, allows the most efficient manner of work progression and minimizes the use of &ldquo;Change Orders&rdquo;  Recent experience in Coronado suggests that FLAGG is able to complete a new Coastal Home from start work to final permit in  8-11 months</p>

    			<p>Coronado, also known as Coronado Island, is an affluent resort city located in San Diego County, California, across San Diego Bay from downtown San Diego.[4] Its population was 24,697 at the 2010 census,[2][3] up from 24,100 at the 2000 census. Coronado lies on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a 10-mile (16 km) isthmus called the Silver Strand (locally, The Strand.) Locals sometimes call Coronado Nado or Coronado Island, and they denote the core living and business area as The Village. In May 2012, Dr. Stephen Leatherman, Director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research, ranked Coronado Beach as the best beach in the United States.[5] <br>
		      Coronado is Spanish for &quot;the crowned one&quot;, and thus it is nicknamed The Crown City. There have been three ships of the United States Navy named after the city, including the USS Coronado (LCS-4).</p>
